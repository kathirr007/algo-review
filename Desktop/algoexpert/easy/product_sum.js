//Product Sum
//Recursion

//my notes
//we have a special array and we need to find the product of it
//a special array that consists of numbers or integers or special arrays
//if a special arrays can contain other special arrays then we know its recursions
//product sum is the sum of all the elements 
//when you get to a special array you multiple those ele plus their depth in the special array
//initial array depth is being multiplied by 1
//second depth array will be multiplied by 2
//third depth array will be multiplied by 3
