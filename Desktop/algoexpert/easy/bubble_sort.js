//Bubble Sort
//Sorting

//my notes
//important algorithm in terms of complexity analysis and helps with the other sort algorithms 
//the goal is to sort a list of numbers in ascending order
//we will iterate the array multiple times and perform swaps
//we will check the current num and if its smaller than or bigger than the next number
//if they are not in order, then we swap the nums in the array
//keep doing this until everything is sorted
//if there are no more swaps then we are done
//[8,5,2,9,5,6,3]
//[5,8,2,9,5,6,3]
//[5,2,8,9,5,6,3]
//[5,2,8,5,9,6,3]
//[5,2,8,5,6,9,3]
//[5,2,8,5,6,3,9] //we are done with ONE iteration but the entire array is not sorted
