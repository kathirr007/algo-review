//Bubble Sort
//Sorting

//my notes
//important algorithm in terms of complexity analysis and helps with the other sort algorithms 
//the goal is to sort a list of numbers in ascending order
//we will iterate the array multiple times and perform swaps
//we will check the current num and if its smaller than or bigger than the next number
