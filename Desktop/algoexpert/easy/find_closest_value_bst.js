//Find Closest Value in BST
//binary Search Tree

//notes
//given a bst and a target int value, we find the closest value to the target value in the bst
//using logic similar to insertion and removal
//we want to initialize a variable that will keep track of the closest value in that bst and continualy update it
//in the beginning we will have the closest val equal to infinity, you can initialize it to whatever and this var will hold the best candidate for the closest value
//we start at the root node and compare this value to the target value
