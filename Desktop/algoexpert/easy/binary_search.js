//in binary search the list and array need to be sorted
//if you have a sorted array in an interview then think about binary search if you can use it
//you going to want to find the middle num in the array first
//based on the middle you'll either look through the first half or the second half of the array
//you will have two pointer - left / right
//they'll be in two opposite spots
