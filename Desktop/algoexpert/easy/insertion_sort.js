//Insertion Sort
//Sorting

//my understanding
//[8,5,2,9,5,6,3]
//[5,8,2,9,5,6,3] --> [2,5,8,9,5,6,3] --> [2,5,5,8,9,6,3] --> [2,5,5,6,8,9,3] --> [2,3,5,5,6,8,9]

//space complexity
//O(1)

//time complexity 
//O(n^2) - we have to do a bunch of comparisons and swaps 
//best case would be an already sorted list which would be O(N)
