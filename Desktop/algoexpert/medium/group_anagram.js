//Group Anagram
//Strings

//my understanding 
//gives us a list of words / strings and write a function that will return a list of other lists of aanagrams 
//anagrams are words that are written in the same letters but written differently
//you can put each word in alphabetical order and match the strings that are identical
//[yo, act, flop, tac, cat, oy, olfp] --> [oy, act, flop, act, act, oy, flop] --> [act, act, act, flop, flop, oy, oy] --> [[yo,oy], [flop, olfp], [act, tac, cat]]
