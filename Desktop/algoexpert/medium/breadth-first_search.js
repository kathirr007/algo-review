//Breadth-First Search
//Graphs 

//my understanding
//harder than depth-first search to implement
//must know
//we are traversing a graph (this ex has a tree-like data structure with nodes in which each node has a name which is a letter in the alphabet and may have children nodes as well)
//write this graph in a breadth-depth first way, grab all the nodes and put them in an array and return that array
//the way bdf works, we want to traverse the graph level by level from the top level aka root level than go down levels
